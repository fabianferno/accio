# Accio

As technology advances, we will require more servers to operate our web applications. It's acceptable to remember one server cred, but remembering thousands isn't.
We present [Accio](https://accio.fabianferno.tech) to you. Accio is a service that allows you to save and share thousands of server credentials with a single click. There's no need to be concerned about data leaks because the credentials are encrypted.

## How do you use

With our minimal UI, Using Accio is a piece of cake. You can choose your mode of login either via email-passwsord/SSO
After logging in, you'll be prompted to provide your server credentials in input fields.
Click submit and voila! your cred is saved, easy-peasy right

## Editing & sharing

Uh oh! I entered a worng ssh passoword
No worries, see the edit icon at top right of the card, click it
edit them in the input fields, click submit and... done

I feel like sharing my creds to a co developer
We got you, See the share icon at top right of the card, click it
provide the recipient's email and name, click submit and... done

This server cred is Reduntant
As developers we know redundance is inevitable
clik the delete icon and... the creds will be removed
