# Accio

- As technology advances, we will require more servers to operate our web applications. It's acceptable to remember one server cred, but remembering thousands isn't
- We present [Accio](https://accio.fabianferno.tech) to you,  a web app that allows you to save and share thousands of server credentials with a single click. There's no need to be concerned about data leaks because the credentials are encrypted.

## How do you use

- With our minimal UI, Using Accio is a piece of cake. You can choose your mode of login either via email-passwsord/SSO.
- After logging in, you'll be prompted to provide your server credentials in input fields.
- Click submit and voila! your cred is saved, easy-peasy right

## Editing & sharing
