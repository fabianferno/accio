# Accio

As technology advances, we will require more servers to operate our web applications. It's acceptable to remember one server cred, but remembering thousands isn't<br/>
We present [Accio](https://accio.fabianferno.tech) to you. Accio is a service that allows you to save and share thousands of server credentials with a single click. There's no need to be concerned about data leaks because the credentials are encrypted.

## How do you use

With our minimal UI, Using Accio is a piece of cake. You can choose your mode of login either via email-passwsord/SSO
After logging in, you'll be prompted to provide your server credentials in input fields.
Click submit and voila! your cred is saved, easy-peasy right

## Editing & sharing

Uh oh! I entered a worng ssh passoword<br/>
- No worries, see the edit icon at top right of the card, click it
- Edit them in the input fields, click submit and... done

I feel like sharing my creds to a co developer<br/>
- We got you, See the share icon at top right of the card, click it
- Provide the recipient's email and name, click submit and... done

This server cred is Reduntant<br/>
- As developers we know redundance is inevitable
- Click the delete icon and... the creds will be removed
